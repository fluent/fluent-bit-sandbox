  Fluent Operator Walkthrough
  ===========================

  Based on https://github.com/kubesphere-sigs/fluent-operator-walkthrough.git, this is a simple walkthrough of how to use the Fluent Operator to dynamically deploy and control both FluentD and Fluent Bit automatically.

  The track will show you examples of how to deploy the Fluent Operator to send logs to tools like Loki, Elasticsearch and Kafka.

  A single node Kubernetes cluster is used to demonstrate everything for this track.
